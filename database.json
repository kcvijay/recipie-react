      "instruction": "Make the filling: In a large bowl, combine the ground chicken, red onion, scallions, cilantro, garlic, ginger, turmeric, chili powder, garam masala, ghee, and olive oil. Mix well with your hands.\nPlace a tablespoon of filling in the middle of a dumpling wrapper. Using your finger, lightly wet the outer rim with water.\nPinch the top of the wrapper, using your fingers to pleat and tighten as you close so it looks like a little pouch. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling.\nBring a large pot filled a third of the way with water to boil over high heat and top with a dumpling steamer basket. Line the basket with cabbage leaves. Steam the momos in batches for 12-15 minutes, until the wrapper becomes slightly translucent.\nMake the dipping sauce: In a medium saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the tomatoes, Thai chilies, garlic, ginger, turmeric, and Szechuan peppers. Season with salt. Cook, stirring occasionally until the tomato is softened, for 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, and let cool for 5-10 minutes.\nTransfer the tomato mixture to a blender and add the sesame seeds and cilantro. Blend until smooth.\nServe the momos with the dipping chutney.\nEnjoy!",

      "description": "Needless to say, pizza is a symbol of Italian tradition, recognized worldwide. Its humble beginnings were as a loaf of bread, enriched with all sorts of ingredients.\n\nThis has, of course, evolved over the years, but something that hasn’t really changed is the preparation of the dough itself.\n\nAll you need is flour, water, yeast, and salt, which can be used in different quantities and forms, depending on how thin or thick you want your pizza to be.",

      "instruction": "To prepare the dough for the pizza, start pouring the flour in a large mixer bowl.\n\nIn a small bowl add luke-warm water and then add the yeast, mixing gently until the yeast is dissolved.\n\nTurn the mixer on with the hook mounted on medium-to-low speed and start pouring the water little by little, making sure you wait for the previous dose to be absorbed by the flour.\n\nKeep kneading until the dough gets smooth and homogeneous. When it gets to that point, keep kneading for about 15/20 minutes.\n\nAdd the salt and keep the mixer running until the salt is fully combined with the dough.\n\nWhen the salt is fully absorbed, remove the dough from the mixer and knead with your hands until you get a large ball.\n\nPlace it in a large bowl, cover with foil or a clean humid cloth, then let it rise in the oven with the light on.\n\nWait until the mixture has at least doubled in volume (after 1.5 h). Ideally, you should let it triple in size (at least 3 hours).\n\nOnce the dough has risen, transfer it on a work surface.\n\nDivide it into 4 equal parts and shape them as balls using your hands. Once done, cover them with a clean cloth and let them stand for 30 minutes at room temperature, before using them to make your pizzas.",
