The purpose of this website is but not limited to learn basics of React including hooks, event handlers, conditional rendering, list and keys, React-router and GET, POST, UPDATE, DELETE from JSON-Server.

User can input their country-specific food recipies and browse other recipies too.

- As an experimental function, users can delete their own recipe but it will require a recipe-specific password which was created during the post.
